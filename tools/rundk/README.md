# rundk

`rundk` is a tool to run a test command from the test image, by using it
developers can reproduce the test flow as run in the CI environment.

## Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) must be installed
- If you run this tool on MAC, `/tmp` directory must be added to Docker's File
  Sharing settings to allow Docker accessing the temporary files created for
  mount, see the
  [comment](https://github.com/docker/docker.github.io/issues/4709#issuecomment-639596451).

## Installation

`rundk` can be installed and upgraded by running:

```shell
go get knative.dev/test-infra/rundk
```

## Usage

```shell
Usage of rundk:
  --image string
      The image we use to run the test flow. (default "gcr.io/knative-tests/test-infra/prow-tests:stable")
  --entrypoint string
      The entrypoint executable that runs the test commands. (default "runner.sh")
  --enable-docker-in-docker
      Enable running docker commands in the test flow.
      By enabling this the container will share the same docker daemon in the host machine, so be careful when using it.
  --use-local-gcloud-credentials
      Use the same gcloud credentials as local.
      It can be set either by setting env var GOOGLE_CLOUD_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS or from ~/.config/gcloud
  --use-local-kubeconfig
      Use the same kubeconfig as local.
      It can be set either by setting env var KUBECONFIG or from ~/.kube/config
  --mounts source1:target1,source2:target2,source3:target3
      A list of extra folders or files separated by comma that need to be mounted to run the test flow.
      It must be in the format of source1:target1,source2:target2,source3:target3.
  --mandatory-env-vars string
      A list of env vars separated by comma that will be promoted to the container.
      They must be set on the local, and users will get an error if they are not set.
  --optional-env-vars string
      A list of env vars separated by comma that will be promoted to the container.
      They can be optionally set on the local, and users will not get an error if they are not set.
```

### Example

Run E2E tests for a Knative repository:

```shell
rundk --use-local-gcloud-credentials -- ./test/e2e-tests.sh --gcp-project-id=one-project-for-testing
```

```shell
rundk --use-local-kubeconfig -- ./test/e2e-tests.sh --run-tests
```

> Note: the `rundk` command must be run under the root or sub directory of your
> local Knative repository.
