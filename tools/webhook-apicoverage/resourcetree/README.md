# Resource Tree

resourcetree package contains types and interfaces that define a resource tree(n-ary tree based representation of an API resource). Each resource tree is composed of nodes which have data encapsulated inside [nodeData](node.go) and operations that can be performed on each node in the interface [INode](node.go). Type of a node is logically defined by reflect.Kind. Each node type is expected to satisfy the [INode](node.go) interface.  

##Resource Forest  
[ResourceForest](resourceforest.go) groups all resource trees that are part of an API version into a single construct and defines operations that span across them. As an example for Knative Serving, we will have individual resource trees for Configuration, Revision, Route and Service, and they are encapsulated inside a resource forest under version v1alpha1. Example of an operation that spans resource trees would be to get coverage details for outlined types connected using ConnectedNodes.

ConnectedNodes represent connections between nodes that are of same type(reflect.Type) and belong to same package but span across different trees or branches of same tree. An example of ConnectedNodes would be v1alpha1.Route.Spec.Traffic and v1alpha1.Route.Status.Traffic, both these Traffic fields are of type v1alpha1.TrafficTarget, but are present in different paths inside the resource tree. ConnectedNodes connects these two nodes, and a outlining of this type would present the coverage across the two branches and gives a unified view of what fields are covered.
