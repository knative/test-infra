# Install go 1.12, 1.13, and 1.14 using https://github.com/moovweb/gvm
# To use this, in Prow jobs set env var GO_VERSION="go1.14" (or go1.13, go1.12, etc)
# You can use e.g. "go1.14" even if we install a specific version here like "go1.14.2"
# (Obviously the version of Go must be installed on the image to be available -- we don't want to be downloading and installing it on every test iteration)
# Missing prerequisite:
RUN apt-get install -y bison
# GVM_NO_UPDATE_PROFILE=true means do not alter /root/.bashrc to automatically source gvm config, so when not using runner.sh, image works normally

# gvm requires one to "source /root/.gvm/scripts/gvm" after installing
#  but in Dockerfile, each RUN is its own shell, so source'd in-RUN env vars are not propagated
# So have created "source-gvm-and-run.sh" to source the above then run gvm
