# Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment system

This directory contains the configs for all tools related to Knative's CI/CD
system. Many of the configs, especially [Prow](https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/tree/master/prow),
are mirror copies from [Kubernetes test-infra](https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra).
For how to work with Prow for Knative, set your repository to integrate with Prow,
and add Prow jobs, please refer to [guides](../guides).
